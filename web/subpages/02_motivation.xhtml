        <p class="medium">                       
            I'm 40 years old with a successful career behind on <span class="colorblue">techno-functional area (15+ years)</span><br/>
            Basically I had <span class="colorblue">ERP system analyst / architect</span> kind of roles at some big multionational companies. <br/>
            I acted as a link between the user and IT groups.
        </p>
        <p class="medium">                                  
            My graduation and people focused personality was a good basic for this kind of role.<br/>
            This was my first "mission" in my life / career. To help the people to understand each other. Users and programmers.<br/>           
        </p>
        <p class="medium">                       
            Now I think I did enough on that area during the many years. I need something new. <span class="colorblue">Refreshing, but still IT </span> <br/>
            I feel a big <span class="colorblue">interest and passion for doing coding and development</span> still.
        </p> 
        <p class="medium">                       
            There was always an idea in my mind <span class="colorblue">to be a developer, programmer</span> at some time. <br/>                        
            I've spent a lot of hours every day with programming (and of course playing) on my PC when I was a young boy.<br/>
            I <span class="colorblue">enjoy on coding to build-up </span>something new which wasn't existing before and <span class="colorblue">like it.</span> <br/>           
            <b class="colorblue">7+ years of programming education</b> <br/>
            &emsp;&emsp;and <b class="colorblue">15+ years on ORACLE EBS as techno-funct</b> should be a good basic to make it.

        </p>
        <p class="medium">                       
            I'm more keen on the  <b class="colorblue">backend (or middleware) area. So the model, controller and business logic layer. </b><br/>
            My in depth knowledge on databases and business processes can help a lot there.                   
        </p>

        <p class="medium">                               
            My mission here is to <b class="colorblue">create quality, re-usable solutions</b> by:
            <ol class="medium">
                <li>understanding the <span class="colorblue">real need of real world.</span> </li>
                <li>...<span class="colorblue">model the problem and the solution</span> in general (create a working abstraction model)</li>
                <li>...and finally using <span class="colorblue">clean coding technics</span> to put the <span class="colorblue">solution</span> into digital form</li>                 
            </ol>
        </p>         
        <p class="medium">                       
            I hope my special career path, background and my introduction webpage will help to achieve it.<br/>
